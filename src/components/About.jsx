        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
          I'm Krishna Murthy Srinivasan, a seasoned Software Development Engineer with over 3 years of hands-on experience in building scalable automation systems, cloud-native tools, and backend services. I specialize in AWS development, Python scripting, CI/CD integration, observability stack design, and enterprise tool automation.
          <br /><br />
          Iâ€™ve architected and deployed robust RPA pipelines, AWS Lambda workflows, Slack-Jira-Wiki automation frameworks, and real-time incident metrics systems. I'm also skilled in building fast APIs using Flask and FastAPI, deploying workloads with Docker/Kubernetes, and orchestrating logging & monitoring solutions with Prometheus, Grafana, Fluent Bit, and Loki.
          <br /><br />
          My drive comes from solving impactful engineering problems that reduce manual effort, increase visibility, and improve reliability across large-scale infrastructure and dev teams.
